• Selenium: For rendering dynamic web pages. <br>
• BeautifulSoup: For parsing and extracting data from HTML. <br>
• Pandas: For organizing the scraped data into a tabular format. <br>

The extracted data is saved in CSV file for further analysis.

## skills Utilised
• Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: Extracting structured information from HTML pages. <br>
• Automating Web Interaction with Selenium: Navigating a website, fetching dynamic content, and controlling the browser. <br>
• Data Extraction & Parsing: Identifying key elements in the HTML using classes and tags. <br>
• String Manipulation: Cleaning and formatting text using regular expressions and string methods. <br>
• Pandas for Data Processing: Organizing extracted data into a structured format (DataFrame) and exporting it to a CSV file. <br>
• Handling Dynamic Web Elementswith implicit wait: Waiting for content to load before scraping using time.sleep(). <br>
• Error Handling & Conditional Logic: Making sure missing elements don’t break the process by applying checks. <br>
